Abstract
- descriptive theory of organisation of natural text
- characterises structure i.t.o relations between parts of text
- definitional foundation
- 3 claims:
    - predominance of nucleus/satellite structural patterns
    - functional basis of hierarchy
    - communicative role of text structure

# Introduction
- RST provides useful combination of features
    - hierarchical structure in etxt
    - relations between text parts
    - comprehensive analsyses
    - insensitive to text size
- ID facts and judgments on which analysis is based
- provide framework for analysing new texts

- providing definitions
- consequences
- written monologue

- describe relations among clauses in a text
- analytical tool for wide range of types
- foundation for studies in contrastive rhetoric
- analysing narrative discourse
- framework for investigating relational propositions

- define symbolic mechanisms of RST, present application

# Definitions for Relations, Schemas and Structures
## Relations
- hold between two non-overlapping text spans (N and S)
- 4 fields:
    - constraints on N
    - constraints on S
    - constraints on combination
    - effect
- each specified judgments made by analyst (plausibility)

- go beyond literal readings

## Schemas
- structural constituency arrangements of text
- abstract patterns consisting of
    - small number of constituent text spans
    - relations among them
    - specification of how certain spans (nuclei) are related to the whole collection
- loosely analogous to grammatical rules

- RST is abstract set of conventions
- independent/inclusive of particular relation definitions (latter)
- various versions based on sets of relation defns and variations in schema defns

- schemas specify how spans of text can co-occur
- determine possible RST text structures
- five schemas (circumstance, contrast, joint, motivation/enablement, sequence+sequence)
- unmentioned relations' schemas follow "circumstance" pattern

- schema name = relation name
- contrast has 2 Ns, sequence & joint have indefinitely many

## Schema Applications
- three conventions
    - unordered spans
    - optional relations
    - repeated relations

## Structural Analyses and Structure Diagrams
- first step: divide text into units
    - should be based on theory-neutral classification
    - usually ~clauses here
- structural analysis = set of schema applications
    - completedness (covers whole text)
    - connectedness (every span either minimal unit or constituent of another SA)
    - uniqueness (every SA has diff set of spans)
    - adjacency (spans of each SA constitute one span)

# Relations and Relation Definitions
- defns do not rely on morphological or syntactic signals
- functional and semantic judgments alone
- open set

## Evidence and Justify
- reader's attitude towards N
- evidence: reader's belief in material ^
  justify : reader's readiness to accept writer's right to present material

### Evidence
- R's comprehending S increases R's belief of N
- R's belief of N ^
- N is locus of effect

### Justify
- R's comprehending S increases R's readiness to accept W's right to present N
- R's readiness to accept W's right to present N ^
- N is locus

## Antithesis and Concession
- desired effect is to cause reader to have positive regard for nucleus
- Antithesis \subseteq Contrast, but not Concession

### Antithesis
- N and S are in contrast (see Contrast)
- because of incompatibility, cannot have positive regard for both N and S
- comprehending S and incompat. increases R's regard for N
- R's positive regard for N ^
- N is locus

### Concession
- "although"
- W acknowledges potential/apparent incompat. betn N and S
- regards them as compatible
- recognising incompat. between them increases R's positive regard for N
- N and S are loci

# Order of Spans
- not constrained by relation, schema defns
- ordering under independent control of writer
- strong patterns of ordering relations are evident
- canonical span often improves text quality

# Distinctions among Relations
- two-way division: subject matter vs. presentational aspect
- possibly aka semantic/pragmatic vs. ideational
- SM wants reader to recognise relation
- prez wants reader's inclination to increase

- can also distinguish locus of effect S vs. N
- or requiring reader action vs. not

# Effects and Functionalism
- Effect is essential part of relation definition
- statement of condition that is routinely achieved through use of relation
- constraint against inapprop use

- for each reln and schema defn, it applies only if plausible that writer wanted to use span to achieve Effect

- :. RST analysis always constitutes plausible account of what writer wanted to achieve
- function account of text

- applicability never depends on form of text

# Use and Consequences of RST
## Results from Text Analysis
- every text has analysis
- some types don't have
- (culture) with-analysis predominate

## Results from Studies of Relational Properties
- text structures conveys relational propositions
- not necessarily clausally expressed
- can be conveyed w/o formal signal
- correspond to relations of RST
- essential to coherence of text

- recognising relations essential for understanding text
- for each relation, corresponding assertional form e.g. evidence

- new class of assertional effects
- not invited inferences, gricean implicatures, opportunistic inferences (all avoidable)
- inevitable

- not compositional
- :. communication effect of text ≠ meanings of sentences
- Effect field: basis for derivation of relational prop

# Analysis of a Larger Text

# Multiple Analyses in RST
- boundary judgements
- text structure ambiguity
- simultaneous analyses
- differences between analysts
- analytical error

# Nuclearity
## What is Nuclearity?
- pairs of spans (relations) comprise text
- relations mostly asymmetric
- regularities across relations
    - if asymmetries arranged into columns, commonalities among elements
- -> nucleus/satellite

- commonalities
    - one member incomprehensibly independent
    - one member more suitable for substitution
    - one member more essential than other

- single pattern represented by assignment of N/S
- IDing N is byproduct of IDing reln

## Text Phenomena that Demonstrate Nuclearity
- several facts support theory of nuclearity
- examine effects of perturbing texts

### Nucleus Deletion and Nuclear Function
- if nucleus removed, significance of material in satellite is not apparent

### Satellite Deletion and Nuclear Function
- text remains coherent
- "synopsis"

### Hypotaxis
- plausible basis for the grammar of hypotactic clause combining

## Multinuclear Constructs
### Enveloping Structures
- texts with conventional openings, closings not easily described i.t.o nuclearity
- e.g. letter

### Parallel Structures

## Functional Interpretation of Nuclearity
- reader adds structure to a linear string
- nuclei suggest organisational details of memories
- signal that memory of S can be accessed through N
- N more central than S
- 2 explanations for types of relns
    - locus N -> qualitative differences in role between essential/inessential, thought/afterthought
        - S supports but doesn't contribute
    - locus both -> structural diff represents distinction in organisation
        - signif of S found in N
- directs R to respond to text in a particular and locally structured way

# Conclusions
- offers useful combination of features
    - IDs hierarchical structure
    - describes relns among text parts functionally
    - comprehensive analyses
    - unaffected by text size
- descriptive basis for studying clause combining
- basis for studying coherence
- :. linguistically useful account of nature of text
