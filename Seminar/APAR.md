# Abstract  
* algo for identifying NP antecedents of 3p pronouns and lexical anaphors
* syntactic reps generated by McCord's parser (McCord 1992)

# Introduction
* both intra and intersentential
* Resolution of Anaphora Procedure (RAP)
* impl in prolog
* measures of salience derived from syntactic structure & a simple dynamic model of attentional state
* no semantic conditions other than GNP, no real-world knowledge

# The Anaphora Resolution Algorithm
* components
    - intrasentential filter for syntactically ruling out anaph. dependence of pronoun on NP
    - morphological filter for ruling out based on GNP
    - procedure to identify pleonastic pronouns
    - anaphor binding algorithm for identifying possible antec. of a lexical anaphor (reci/refl pron.) in same sentence
        - Lappin, McCord 1990b
    - procedure to assign values to salience params (role, parallelism, freq, proximity, recency) for NP
        - Leass, Schwall 1991
        - subject > non-subject; DO > other compls; verb args > adjuncts/args of PPs; heads > compls
            Gunthner, Lehmann 1983
    - procedure to identify anaphorically linked NPs as an equiv class; global salience value
    - procedure for selecting preferred among antec. candidates

## Some Preliminary Details
- implemented in Eng and Ger
- integrated into LMT (McCord 1989ab)
- clausal rep = set of prolog unit clauses that provide info on head-arg and head-adj relations
    - reps of prev 4 sentences retained
- all NPs have an ID

### The Syntactic Filter on Pronoun-NP Coreference
- 6 conditions for intrasentential NP-pronoun non-coreference
- terminology
    - agreement features of NP are GNP
    - P is in arg domain of N if P, N are args of same head
    - P is in adj domain of N if N is an arg of H, P is the object of PREP, an adj of H
    - P is in NP domain of N if N is the det of Q, P is `arg of` OR `obj of PREP, an adj of` Q
    - P is contained in Q if P is an arg/adj of Q (immediately contained) or if P is contained in something contained in Q
- P is non-coreferential with an NP N (non-reci, non-refl) if any of these:
    - P and N have incompatible agr features
    - P is in the arg domain of N
    - P is in the adj domain of N
    - P is the arg of H, N not a pron., N contained in H
    - P is in NP domain of N
    - P is determiner of Q, N contained in Q

### Test for Pleonastic Pronouns
- half syntactic, half lexical
- modal adjectives (necessary, possible, etc)
- cognitive verbs (recommend, think, etc)

### The Anaphor Binding Algorithm
- subj > agent > obj > (i|p)obj
- N is a possible antecedent binder for a lexical anaphor (reci/refl pron.) A iff A, N are compatible wrt GNP and one of
    - A is in the arg domain of N, N > A
    - A is in the adj domain of N
    - A is in the NP domain of N
    - N is an arg of V, there is an NP Q in the arg/adj domain of N with no noun determiner, and A is an arg of Q or an arg of PREP, an adj of Q
    - A is a det of Q, Q is in the arg domain of N and N > A, or Q is in the adj domain of N

### Salience Weighting
- salience factors, associated with ≥ 1 discourse referents (in its scope)
- weight assoc to each factor
    - Alshawi 1987
- when a new sentence is processed, factors assigned before this are degraded by 2x
- discourse referents of current sentence are tested for salience factors, new factors are created including them
- factors
    - subject emphasis
    - existential emphasis
    - accusative emphasis
    - indirect object, oblique complement emphasis
    - head noun emphasis (any NP not contained in another)
    - non-adverbial emphasis (any NP not contained in an adverbial PP demarcated by a separator)

### Equivalence Classes
- treat antecedent-anaphor as equality in DRT
    - Kamp 1981
- not symmetric: "y antecedes u"
- coref(y,u) [y and u are coreferential] if either antecedes the other, recursively
    - reflexive
    - therefore equiv classes equiv(y) = {y | coref(u,y)}
- each class has a salience weight (sum of current weight of all salience factors in whose scope at least one member lies)

- all this is dynamic system for computing relative attentional prominence of denotational NPs

## The Resolution Procedure
- create list of IDs for all NPs in the current sentence, classify as definite NP/pleonastic pron./other pron./indef NP
- examine each
    - distinguish NPs with new discourse referents/those that are coreferential/non-referential
    - apply salience factors
    - apply syntactic filter, reflexive binding algorithm
        - if any pers/poss prons, rule out some pairs syntactically (%)
        - if any lexical anaphors, a list of antecedents (anaphor binding algorithm)
    - if any non-pleonastic prons, identify antecedents in the order of occurrence

- for 3p prons
    - list of possible antecedents (most recent discourse referent of each equiv class)
    - salience weight is calculated (these modifications are local)
        - if it follows pronoun, reduced
        - if same slot, increased
    - salience threshold
    - determine possible sg/pl genders
    - if any sg gender determined:
        - morphological filter
        - syntactic filter from (%)
        - candidate with highest weight, break ties by closeness
    - if any pl gender determined
        - morph filter
        - synt filter
        - candidate with highest weight, break ties by closeness
    - choose from above 2 by weight

- properties of RAP
    - powerful synt, morph filter
    - salience measures in terms of syntactic properties/relations (hierarchy, level of embedding, parallelism), freq
    - proximity of NP is used for tiebreaking
    - intrasentential antecedents preferred, by
        - additional salience to NPs in current sentence
        - degradation of candidates in preceding sentences
        - proximity is used to tiebreak
    - anaphora >> cataphora

# Examples of RAP's Output
## Lexical Anaphors

## Pleonastic and Non-Lexical Anaphoric Pronouns in the Same Sentence

## Multiple Cases of Intrasentential Anaphora

## Intersentential and Intrasentential Anaphora in the Same Sentence

## Displaying Discourse Referents

## Detailed Displays of Salience Weights

# Testing of RAP on Manual Texts
## Limitations of the Current Algorithm

## The Relative Contributions of the Salience Weighting Mechanisms

# Salience and Statistically Measured Lexical Preference
* RAPSTAT assigns statistical score to each member of the candidate list and combines it with the salience value
* if the difference between C1 and C2 (top 2) does not exceed a threshold and C2 is significantly greater than C1, then C2 is preferred; else C1 remains
    - if C2 is picked, it proceeds down the list
* 
## A Blind Test of RAP and RAPSTAT

# Comparison with Other Approaches to Anaphora Resolution
## Hobbs' Algorithm
* simple tree search procedure
* does not deal with pleonastic pronouns or lexical anaphors
* better for intersentential anaphors

## Discourse Based Methods

## Mixed Models
* syntactic, semantic and discourse factors

# Conclusion
* structural factors help a lot
* semantic/pragmatic conditions apply to output of a syntax-based algorithm
