# Abstract
* modified and extended from LL94
* output of PoS tagger, annotation of grammatical fn

# Overview
* syntactic parsing not accurate enough
* flat morphosyntactic analysis of sentences

# General Outline of the Algorithm
* base level is output of PoS tagger, with syntactic fn annotations
* generated by Voutilainen 92, Karlsson 95 (lingsoft)

## Data Collection
* list of all NPs : phrasal grammar
* contexts of NPs – adverbial adjunct / NP
* expletive it
* discourse referents – rep in CLOS
    - no info about configurational relns among referents

## Anaphora Resolution
* logic is like LL
* L2R, sentence by sentence
* each referent is either a new participant, or a previously interpreted referent
* elimination followed by selection (by salience)

### Coreference
* coreference = equiv classes
* classes impl as CLOS objects

### Salience
* same factors, weight a LL
* except POSS-S, CNTX-S
* updation of class salience as in LL
* decay function

### Interpretation
* first decrease existing corefs
* find referents in current sentence, create new class, calculate weight
* for lexical anaphors, find candidate pairs (identified by lingsoft)
    - direct object reflexive : closest subject
    - ind. obj./oblique : closest subject + closest direct object not separated by subject
* for pronouns, generate candidates and use weights
    - eliminate candidates with GNP, disjoint reference filter **X**
        + cannot corefer with coarg (all DO/IO/Ob following pronoun with SUB/DO, with no intervening SUB)
        + cannot corefer with nonpronominal const which it commands and precedes (eliminate following refs)
        + cannot corefer with container (eliminates refs with nonnil embed value)
    - from candidate antecedents, cataphora penalised, locality/parallelism rewarded
        + locality : to negate effects of subordination if in same subordinate context **X**
        + parallelism : pair of gfun values are identical to previous pair
    - ranked according to weight and determined
    - tie broken with distance
    - salience of classes recalculated

# Example Output

# Evaluation
* 75%
* but no gender
* observations
    - improve with morph, context info
    - no config info but not that much less acc

# Conclusion
