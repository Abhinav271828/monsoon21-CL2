* the intepretation of an occurrence of one expression depends on the that of another, OR
* an occurrence of an expression has its referent supplied by an occurrence of some other expression in the same or another sentence

* pronominal anaphora  
    `John left. He said he was ill.`
* VP anaphora/ellipsis  
    `Mary took out the trash. Claudia did too.`
* propositional anaphora  
    `One plaintiff was passed over for promotion three times. But the jury didn’t believe this.`
* adjectival anaphora  
    `A kind stranger returned my wallet. Such people are rare.`
* modal anaphora  
    `John might give a presentation. He would use slides.`
* temporal anaphora  
    `Sheila had a party last Friday and Sam got drunk.`
* kind-level anaphora  
    `John gave a presentation. Sarah gave one too.`

* can be cataphora (backwards anaphora)

# Unproblematic Anaphora
* pick up a reference from a previous RE
* RE is called antecedent
* antecedent could be quantifier (`Every farmer beats his donkey`)
    - variables bound by antecedents  
    - binding theory

# Problematic Anaphora
* discourse anaphora (intrasentential): not bound vars
    - `Few professors came to the party. They had a good time.`  
    -  `John bought no sheep and Harry vaccinated them.`  
    - `Every professor came to the party. He had a great time.`  
    - `Few students came to the party. They were busy studying.`  
    - indefinite antecedents
* Geach discourse
    - `Hob thinks a witch blighted Bob’s mare. Nob wonders whether she killed Cob’s sow.`
* donkey anaphora
    - conditional: `If Sarah owns a donkey, she beats it.`  
    - relative clause: `Every woman who owns a donkey beats it.`

# Recent Theories of Problematic Anaphora
## Discourse Representation Theory
* designed to handle donkey and discourse anaphora
* indefinite NPs are predicates with free vars
* donkey anaphora
    - conditional, universal quantifier have universal force
    - bind variables
    - proportion problem

## Dynamic Semantic Approaches
* preserve dynamic elements of DRT, adhere to compositionality
* Dynamic Predicate Logic
* syntactic scope of quantifier is in sentence only
* existential quantifier
    - intepreted as set of pairs of input and output assgmt functions
    - externally dynamic
* conjunction
    - left conjunct interpretation can affect right conjunct
* donkey anaphora
* three problems
    - disjunctive antecedents
    - paycheck pronoun
    - no proper linguistic antecedent

## Descriptive Apprpaches
* anaphoric pronouns function like definite descriptions (E- or D-type approaches)
* E-type: definite description fixes referent of an anaphoric pronoun
* D-type: pronoun has the semantics of a definite description
* Neale's view
    - anaphoric pronouns go proxy for def descriptions as quantifiers
    - or numberless descriptions
* Elbourne's view
    - NP-deletion theory
    - pronouns have semantics of determiners
    - situation semantics
* mixed approaches

## The Context Dependent Quantifier Approach
* expressions look like quantifier-like expressions of generality
* ordinary quantifiers have force, restriction, scope
    - pronouns have these determined by linguistic envts
* donkey anaphora
    - conditional

# How Many Readings Do Donkey Sentences Have?
* strong/weak
* but some have only weak
* variety of factors
* can also be mixed

# Anaphora in Sign Language
* antecedent associated with a position called locus
* anaphoric link is pointing
* no upper bound
* single system of anaphora for individuals, times, worlds
* loci ~ indices ~ dynamic semantic acct of pronominal anaphora (vars = loci)
* SL prons have iconic element
